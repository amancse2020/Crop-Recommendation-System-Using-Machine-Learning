# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning
- Implemented a machine learning project to predict suitable crops for specific soil types
- Conducted two phases of the project: training phase and testing phase
- Utilized two datasets: Soil dataset and crop dataset
- Classified soil types using machine learning methods, specifically SVM algorithm
- Used two-thirds of the samples to train the model and one-third to test the model
- Achieved good accuracy in soil classification through the SVM algorithm
- Provided recommendations for suitable crops based on the classified soil types.
